# W.D.T. Definition

W.D.T. is a code-golfing language that can be (theoretically) used for anything, but would be extremely impractical.
The name stands for W.eird D.ata T.ypes and means that instead of normal data types, it has weird replacements.

Take a look at this example:
```
@l1,2,3,4
2,4,6,8
3,6,9,12
4,8,12,16

l|s!":"
>l
```

> _**NOTE**: some newlines are `\n` while others are `\r`_
